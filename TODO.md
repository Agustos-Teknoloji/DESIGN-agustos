- Register printer-matched CMYK and Pantone values for the six colours and the identity inks in `brand/brands.json`, then show them on the colour page of `brand/build_guidelines.py`. Ask the printer for a proof first; do not convert the screen values.
- Rebuild `adapters/astro/src/pages/blog/index.astro` on `type-dl` and `type-footnote`, like `screens/content-index.html`. Remove its scoped `<style>` block and the H2 for each post title, which break the list-page rule.
- Close PR #12 ("Register the SpecQuick house brand") as superseded, or rebase it on the root doc set. SpecQuick is already registered on `main`, and the PR still writes the old root `MEMORY.md`.
- Topbar menu: tighten the spacing of `site-header__nav` between 1024 and 1280px, so long Turkish labels fit on one row (Emre, 2026-09-27: for the future).
